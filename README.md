THE WORLD IS SPIKY
======
Introduction
---------
Thomas Friedman argued in 2005 that globalization and innovation had made the world flat, but that's not the case - as Richard Florida has argued, the world is spiky. Innovation is not universal; rather, certain places establish themselves as the center of various industries. For code, Silicon Valley and the Bay are the top. For fashion, New York City and Milan remain the epicenters. *The World Is Spiky* is our attempt to visually demonstrate this concept by drawing a visual comparison of For Sale postings in 10 cities across 10 categories.
About the Project
-------
*The World Is Spiky* was the winning Visuals entry for the 3Taps Hackathon in San Francisco on April 30th. The project was created over a few hours and relies on 3taps' (awesome) api for its data. We use Javascript and WebGL - the project doesn't need to be run on a server, but it does require a very new version of either Chrome, Firefox, or Webkit. It has not been extensively tested or optimized, and is currently more art than technique.
